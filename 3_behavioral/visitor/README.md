Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

- Use the Visitor when you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, an object tree).
- Use the Visitor to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
- Use the pattern when a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.
