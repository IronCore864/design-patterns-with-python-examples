Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

- Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
- Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
